(At this point we only have movement)
1) W should be jump? preference. Controls might be a little unnatural to others

MAYBE: W and Space both function as jump

More animations needed, more feedback.
Actual movement feels nice however.

2) Good sprite for chef
Good mechanic in varying the jump by holding / just tapping
still no feedback on the actual movement. Seems like we have it.

3) Movement feels good once again
Fits well into larger scheme of game.
Hold is a little high, adjust force going down?

4) Good mechanic in varying the jump
Good sprite for chef
Good idle, more feedback good
